# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually X and O). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This README will guide you through the installation, features, and usage of the Tic Tac Toe game.

## Installation
To play Tic Tac Toe, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Game:** Download the Tic Tac Toe game files from the repository hosting platform where it is available. This may be GitHub, a software development website, or another source.

2. **Extract the Files:** If the game is compressed into a ZIP file, extract the files to a location on your computer where you want to install the game.

3. **Run the Game:** Once the game files are extracted, open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the game files, and run the main executable file or script.

4. **Access the Game:** The game will start in the terminal or command prompt window. Follow the on-screen instructions to start playing.

## Features
Tic Tac Toe offers the following features:

**Two-player Gameplay:** Play against a friend or family member in a classic two-player mode. Take turns marking spaces on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

**Single-player Mode (Optional):** Play against an AI opponent if a second player is not available. Choose from different difficulty levels, ranging from easy to hard, to challenge your skills.

**Customizable Symbols:** Customize the player symbols used in the game. By default, players use 'X' and 'O', but you can choose any other symbols you prefer.

**Interactive User Interface:** Enjoy an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed for easy gameplay and enjoyment. The game board is displayed clearly, and players can easily select their moves using keyboard input.

**Winning Conditions:** Win the game by placing three of your symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the board. The game automatically detects winning combinations and announces the winner.

**Draw Detection:** If all spaces on the board are filled without either player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw, and no winner is declared.

## Usage

1. **Start the Game:** Launch the game by running the main executable file or script as described in the installation instructions.

2. **Enter Player Names (Optional):** If playing in two-player mode, enter the names of the two players when prompted. If playing against the AI, you may be asked to choose the difficulty level.

3. **Take Turns:** Players take turns marking spaces on the 3x3 grid by entering the coordinates of the desired position (e.g., A1, B2, C3). The game alternates between players until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

4. **Win the Game:** Win the game by placing three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game will announce the winner and display the winning combination on the board.

5. **Play Again (Optional):** After the game ends, players have the option to play again. Choose to start a new game with the same settings or exit the game.
